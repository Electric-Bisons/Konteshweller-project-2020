//  Coding Rules for AVR

- use only effiecint data types for space like uint8_t for 8 bit, uint16_t for 16 bit, etc.
- use bitfields for efficient data size in struct types
- use descriptive names for data variables and functions: u8Data, tempu8Data for uint8_t or u16Data, etc.
- comment almost every line of code for good understanding
- external variables should be declared inside header files
- make intialization for any variable
- use efficient names for files
- write small and efficient code so no useless code lines are used
- ues defines when they are necessary
- place drivers inside specific folder and all of them inside src folder to keep the code clean
- try to avoid floats or double data types
